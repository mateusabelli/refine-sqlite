Start the development of your next refine app with a lightweight local database!

This integration with the [refine](https://refine.dev/) framework makes the lightweight [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database available for usage within your app, with simple methods like `getList`, `create`, `update`, and more!
